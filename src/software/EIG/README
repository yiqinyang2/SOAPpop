EIGENSOFT version 4.2, 08/30/11 (for Linux only)

The EIGENSOFT package implements methods from the following 2 papers:
Patterson et al. 2006 PLoS Genet 2:e190 (population structure)
Price et al. 2006 Nat Genet 38:904-9 (EIGENSTRAT stratification correction)

NEW features of EIGENSOFT version 4.2 include:
-- Minor bug fix to include smarteigenstrat.perl in ./bin directory.

NEW features of EIGENSOFT version 4.1 include:
-- Major bug fix for input of very large data sets, which cause version 4.0beta to crash.

NEW features of EIGENSOFT version 4.0 beta include:
-- Support for multi-threading
-- Ability to process non-human data sets (i.e., adjustable number of autosomes)
-- Hardy-Weinberg filter
-- Ability to exclude regions from analysis
-- Ability to reorder SNPs and/or individuals in output of convertf utility
-- Ability to merge phased data with mergeit utility

Executables and source code:
----------------------------
All C executables are in the bin/ directory.

We have placed source code for all C executables in the src/ directory, 
for users who wish to modify and recompile our programs.  For example, to
recompile the eigenstrat program, type
"cd src"
"make eigenstrat"      
"mv eigenstrat ../bin"

Note that some of our software will only compile if your system has the
lapack package installed.  (This package is used to compute eigenvectors.)
Some users may need to change "blas-3" to "blas" in the Makefile,
depending on how blas and lapack are installed.

If you have trouble compiling and running our code, try compiling and
running the pcatoy program in the src directory:
"cd src"
"make pcatoy"
"./pcatoy"
If you are unable to run the pcatoy program successfully, please contact
your system administrator for help, as this is a systems issue which is
beyond our scope.  Your system administrator will be able to troubleshoot
your systems issue using this trivial program.  [You can also try running
the pcatoy program in the bin directory, which we have already compiled.]

To remake the entire package:
"cd src"
"make clobber"
"make install"

Acknowledgements:
We would like to thank John Novembre and Mike Boursnell for code improvements 
and especially Matt Hanna for the first implementation of multi-threading.
