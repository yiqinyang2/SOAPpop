Documentation for iHS executable amd source

This tarball contains a (64-bit) executable for computing iHS, along with
sample input files and source code. The input haplotype format is one haplotype per
line, with derived alleles coded as 0 and ancestral alleles coded as
1. The map file has the columns rs#, physical position, genetic
position, and the alleles that correspond to 0 and 1.

To run the program, the command is ./ihs <map file> <haplotype file>,
or for the example:
./ihs sample.ihsmap sample.ihshap

Output is to standard out, and the relevant columns are 1,2,3 and 6,
which are the rs#, physical position, allele frequency, and
unstandardized iHS, respectively. The iHS scores should then be
normalized in derived allele frequency bins as in Voight et al. (2005)

To compile, use the following commands:
g++ -c Ehh.cc PData.cc
g++ Ehh.o PData.cc -o ihs
